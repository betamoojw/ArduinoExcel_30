# ArduinoExcel_30
 
Arduino Excel (former Arduino Excel Commander) is a powerful interface between Arduino and MS Excel that supports data exchanging in both directions.

Excel can represent real time data from sensors or it can be used as an extern database to overcome Arduino memory limitations. The main purposes are:
•	data harvesting and consolidation
•	monitoring activities with email alerts
•	support for experiments or advanced applications (eg: robotic devices driven by Arduino)
Arduino Excel is typically used in prototypes but even in some professional applications for scientific experiments or industrial data harvesting accomplished with cheap hardware.

The main features are:
•	data writing to any worksheet / cell
•	data retrieving from any worksheet / cell
•	email sending for alarms or notifications
•	CSV files writing
Up to four Arduino can be connected at the same time thru USB ports.
